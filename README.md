# DJ Bot

DJ Bot is a chatbot that asks about your mood, assesses it as good, bad, or neutral, and suggests a playlist to match.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed.
2. Activate your environment:
   conda activate nlp
3. To run the code you will need spotify api credentials (Client ID and client secret). I did not want to include my own credentials in the public git repository so I made the code to run only after you have entered this into the terminal line:
   python run_chatbot.py <client_id> <client_secret>

   I have included my own client ID and client secret in the zip file containing the link to my git repository that I submitted.

4. Run the bot
