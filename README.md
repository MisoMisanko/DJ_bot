# DJ Bot

DJ Bot is a chatbot that asks about your mood, assesses it and suggests a playlist to match. It also includes a special feature to generate a personally curated Spotify playlist.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed.
2. Activate your environment:
conda activate nlp

3. Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. You will need Spotify API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) to run the bot. Enter the following command in the terminal:
python run_chatbot.py <client_id> <client_secret>

5. Interact with the bot to get personalized playlist recommendations.

## Notes
- My own Spotify API credentials are included in the zip file containing the link to this repository.
